                                                                                @Async Annotation


- Imagine you're at a pizza shop. You place an order, and instead of waiting at the counter until the pizza is ready, they tell you:
“You can go sit. We'll bring it to your table when it's done.”

That’s what @Async does!
It lets your program say: Hey, go do this big task (like sending an email) in the background. I’ll keep working on other stuff.

@Async is a Spring Boot annotation used to run methods in the background — so your main thread doesn't get stuck waiting.
- It's part of Spring's Asynchronous support, and helps you improve performance and user experience.


Real-Life Use Cases:
| Task                   | Why use @Async?                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Send an email          | Don't keep the user waiting               |
| Generate a report      | Takes time — better run in background     |
| Call third-party API   | Don't let slow services block your system |
| Send SMS/notifications | Better done in parallel                   |
| Upload/download files  | Keeps the main flow responsive            |
