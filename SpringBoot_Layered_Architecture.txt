JAR VS WAR

- JAR
    Jar means Java Archive
    Whereever you need stand alone Java application you have to use only JAR.
    Package Java standalone applications (non-web apps)

-WAR 
    War means Web Archive
    When you need a complete package such as HTML, CSS, JS, JSP... etc, then you should go for WAR. 
    Package Java web applications (Servlets, JSPs, etc.)

-Earlier we used to use WAR but nowadays in the world of microservices each microservice each component is
 a standalone application.

Clients hit the API's

1st Layer: Controller Layer
- This layer has all the classes with @Controller, @RestController which hosts to the endpoints. 
- Controller layer is the first starting point which host the apis. 

2nd Layer: Service Layer
- This layer is the layer which is annotated with @Service and where we put the Business logic. 

3rd Layer: Repository Layer
- This layer is annotated with @Repository and which is connected to DB maybe MYSQL, NoSQL.
- This layer interact with the db, fetch the data, and return to the service layer. 
- It's used to interact with the db. 

** Apart from these layers there are additional packages which play important role such as:
 
1. DTO (Data Transfer Object): 
- There are 2 types called as Request DTO and Response DTO. 
- In Request DTO we map the data which is coming from the client or outside the component to request DTO.  
- Similary Respnose DTO will send the data after doing all the business logic and fetching databases. It'll
  send the data back to client via reponse. 

2. Utility
- Utlility is like its common for Service layers, if there are multiple service layers and there is a common method 
  which is used by service layer then this method we can put into "Utlitiy package" called  as helper methods. 

3. Entity
- These are the classes like POJO which consists of certain fields, methods, getter & setters which is a direct
  representation of a table.
- Spring DataJPA internally do the mapping. 
- Entity is direct representation of our tables.
- Generally it is being used by the Repositories. 

4. Configuration
- There is a file named as application.properties.
- Hardcoded values are generally avoided and it should be driven through configuration so that it can be changed without code changes.
