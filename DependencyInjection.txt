What is Dependency Injection?
- Using Dependecy Injection, we can make our class independent of its dependencies. 
- It helps to remove the dependency on concrete implementation and inject the dependencies from external source. i.e Spring
- It breaks Dependency Inversion rule of S.O.L.I.D principle. 
- This principle says that DO NOT depend on concrete implementation, rather depends on abstraction. 

@Autowired, first look for a bean of the required type.
- If bean found, Spring will inject it. 

Different ways of Injection and which one is better?
    - Field Injection
    - Setter Injection
    - Constructor Injection (In Industry we mostly used Constructor injection)

1. Field Injection 
    - Dependecy is set into the fields of the class directly.
    - Spring uses reflection, it iterates over the fields and resolve the dependency. 
 ** Advantage:   
    - Very simple and easy to use. 
 ** Disadvantage:
    - Can not be used with Immutable fields. 
    - You can't use final. 
    - Chances of Null Pointer Exception. 
    - During Unit Testing, setting MOCK dependency to this field becomes difficult. 


2. Setter Injection
    - Dependecy is set into the fields using the setter method. 
    - We have to annotate the method using @Autowired. 
 ** Advantage:
    - Dependecy can be changed any time after the object creation (as object can not be marked as final)
    - Ease of testing, as we can pass object in the dependency easily. 
 ** Disadvantage:
    - Field can not be marked as final (We can not make it immutable.)
    - Difficult to read and maintained, as per standary, object should be initialized during object creation, so this might create code readability issue. 


3. Constructor Injection
    - Dependecy get resolved at the time of initialization of the Object itself. 
    - Its recommended to use. 
    - When only 1 constructor is present, then using @Autowired on constructor is not mandatory. (from Spring version 4.3)
    - When more than 1 constructor is present, then using @Autowired on constructor is mandatory.

-------------------Why Constructor Injection is Recommended  (Advantages):-------------------

1. All mandatory dependencies are created at the time of initialization itself. Makes 100% sure that our object is fully 
   initialized with mandatory depedency. 
        i. avoid NPE during runtime. 
       ii. Unnecessary null checks can be avoided too. 
2. We can create immutable object using Constructor injection. 
3. Fail Fast: If there is any missing dependency, it will fail during compilation itself, rather than failing during run Time. 
4. Unit testing is easy.


--------------------------- Common Issues when dealing with Dependency Injection ---------------------------

1. CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY
SOLUTION: 
    - First and foremost, can we refactor the code and remove this cycle depedency:
      For example, common code in which both are dependent, can be taken out to seperate class. This way we can break the circular depedency. 
    - Using @Lazy on @Autowired annotation.
      Spring will create proxy bean instead of creating the bean instance immediately during application startup. 
    - @Lazy on setter injection. 
    - Use @Primary annotation: This tell that give the first priority who has been annotated with @Primary
    - Using @Qualifier annotation: Application will provide a name. Use @Qualifier and give some name to it.  



2. UNSATISFIED DEPENDENCY
